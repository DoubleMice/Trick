i have two pc but only one monitor, use this to switch monitor input source between two pc.

    - install [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
    - load the *.ahk script

- usage example:
    - `ctrl+alt+g`: get current monitor input source id
    - `ctrl+alt+h`: set monitor input source from my HP laptop
    - `ctrl+alt+p`: set monitor input source from my PC desktop
